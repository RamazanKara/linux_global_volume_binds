This script created 4 alias in your bashrc:

vup: increases the volume by 2db
vdown: decreases the volume by 2db
vfull: increases the volume to 100percent
vmute: mute or unmute your volumecontrols.

Simply place this script somewhere on your linux server and run it with /path/volumebindings.sh

Works on any Distro that uses amixer for volume control and has a bashrc, tested on Ubuntu 18.04

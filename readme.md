# Linux global volume binds

## Usage

This script created 4 alias in your bashrc:

### vup: increases the volume by 2db

### vdown: decreases the volume by 2db

### vfull: increases the volume to 100percent

### vmute: mute or unmute your volumecontrols.

## Installation

Simply place this script somewhere on your linux server and run it with /path/volumebindings.sh

Works on any Distro that uses amixer for volume control ( eg. Debian/Ubuntu ) and has a bashrc, tested on Ubuntu 18.04
